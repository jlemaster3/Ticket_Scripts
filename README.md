Tickets are currently built as scripts using the /ToolBox_ECS_V1/ module that is in development, some older and archive tickets may use the modules and previous versions found under the '/obsolete/' directory.

The ‘/ToolBox_ECS_V2/’ directory is for a work in progress single import set of scripts and tools for large scale actions or changes to multiple configuration files at the same time using rules and filters.

This set of tools is intended for use by the ITO-Batch Scheduling team to make wide sweeping changes to individual configuration files used in the current IWS scheduling environment.  These set of tools are being built primarily for the ITO-Batch Scheduling Teams use when manipulating the local copy of the configuration repositories hosted through Azure DevOps.

‘/ToolBox_ECS_V2/’ is still a Work in Progress:
    Requirments:
        Pandas    
        Numpy
        Openpyxl


‘/ToolBox_ECS_V1/’ is stilla ctive for current ticket but will be phased out for new requests, and will be moved to /Obsolete/ once all current funtionality is moved to V2.
